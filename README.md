## About This Project <a name="about"></a>
Click to enter tasks for each hour of the work day. The input will be saved to local storage. The time blocks are color coded to indicate past(grey), present(red), future(green). Once you enter the task in the textarea field, you can click the save button on the right. If you refresh the page, you will not lose any entires. Previous entries that are logged in local storage will appear on page once it's refreshed. Clear local storage to prevent this from happening.
